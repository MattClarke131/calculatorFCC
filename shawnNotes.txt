Shawn Notes!

1. Try object oriented programming
  1.1 Every function should be a method of a calculator object
  1.2 Test this by having multiple calculators on one page.
  1.3 Put the calculator class into a different file
  1.4 Write a test script for the calculator class
  1.5 The Calculator Class would not care about rendering results.
      It would only produce results.
      "Separation of concerns"
2. Separating concerns with functions
  2.1 calculate() function should not do the truncating
3. Try to get number keys to work
4. If you're adding custom attributes, it's a good convention is to use
  "data-" and then whatever your custom attribute is.
  4.1. HTML5 has left data- for custom attributes.
  4.2 Here's how to access these custom attributes:
      ?? maybe: element.attr("data-number")
      with jQuery: el.data("number")
